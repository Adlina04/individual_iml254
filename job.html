<center><i><font size="4" face="cursive">After finishing the 5th form and finished the SPM exam, my cousin Ayu and I applied for a part-time job near her house
<br>which is the Western Soru Station Sungai Besi. And we got a job there. I am happy to make new friends. I also learned how hard it is to find money. I only
<br>worked here for only 8 months before I got an application to enter the pre-diploma. However, every time during semester break, me and Ayu always ask for
<br>part-time work there. the manager there also welcomed the arrival of both of us to work.</font></i></center>
